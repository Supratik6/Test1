Hereâ€™s a **full synopsis** covering everything we've discussed so far on **Java Multithreading**, including theory and key examples:

---

## ðŸ“˜ **SYNOPSIS: Java Multithreading**

### ðŸ”· **Objective**

To understand and implement the concept of multithreading in Java, demonstrating thread creation, control methods, lifecycle monitoring, priority handling, daemon threads, and thread-safe operations using `synchronized`.

---

### ðŸ”· **Introduction to Multithreading**

* **Multithreading** allows multiple threads (independent paths of execution) to run concurrently.
* Java supports multithreading via the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface.
* Helps in building responsive, high-performance applications.

### ðŸ”· **Key Concepts & Methods**

| Concept/Method                   | Description                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Thread` class                   | Core Java class used to create threads.                               |
| `Runnable` interface             | Preferred way to implement threads when not extending `Thread`.       |
| `start()`                        | Starts a new thread and calls `run()` internally.                     |
| `run()`                          | Defines the task to be executed by a thread.                          |
| `sleep(ms)`                      | Pauses the thread for a given number of milliseconds.                 |
| `join()`                         | Waits for a thread to finish before continuing.                       |
| `yield()`                        | Suggests the scheduler to pause the current thread to let others run. |
| `isAlive()`                      | Checks if the thread is still running.                                |
| `getId()`, `getName()`           | Fetches thread ID and name respectively.                              |
| `setPriority()`, `getPriority()` | Sets/gets priority (range: 1 to 10).                                  |
| `interrupt()`                    | Interrupts a thread if itâ€™s blocked/sleeping.                         |
| `isInterrupted()`                | Checks if a thread has been interrupted.                              |
| `setDaemon(boolean)`             | Marks a thread as a daemon (runs in background).                      |
| `isDaemon()`                     | Checks if thread is a daemon.                                         |
| `getState()`                     | Returns the current state (NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, etc.).             |
| `synchronized`                   | Ensures that only one thread can access a critical section at a time. |

### ðŸ”· **Programs Covered**

#### âœ… 1. **Basic Thread with getId() and getName()**

* Creating threads using the `Thread` class.
* Getting ID and name of each thread.

#### âœ… 2. **Setting Thread Priority**

* Using `setPriority()` and `getPriority()` methods.
* Threads with different priorities.

#### âœ… 3. **Yield and isAlive**

* Using `Thread.yield()` to voluntarily pause execution.
* Checking thread status using `isAlive()` before and after `join()`.

#### âœ… 4. **Runnable Interface**

* Creating threads by implementing the `Runnable` interface.
* Useful for separating logic from thread management.

#### âœ… 5. **Daemon and Interrupt**

* Setting a thread as a daemon using `setDaemon(true)`.
* Using `interrupt()` to break from sleeping or infinite loops.

#### âœ… 6. **Thread State Monitoring**

* Using `getState()` to print the state of a thread at different lifecycle points.

#### âœ… 7. **Synchronized Method**

* Demonstrating thread safety by synchronizing access to a shared method using `synchronized`.

### ðŸ”· **Conclusion**

Multithreading in Java enables efficient, responsive, and scalable applications by executing multiple operations simultaneously. Proper control through synchronization, priorities, daemon settings, and state monitoring ensures safe and optimized performance.
