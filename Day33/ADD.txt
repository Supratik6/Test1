Yes â€” if you added a file (like a `.txt` or `.java`) inside `Day33`, you'd typically follow **these 4â€“5 Git commands** to push your changes:

---

### âœ… Minimal Command Set (Once youâ€™ve added the file):

```bash
git add Day33                         # Stage the Day33 folder and its contents
git status                            # (Optional) Check whatâ€™s being staged
git commit -m "Added Day33 tasks"     # Commit with a message
git push                              # Push changes to GitHub
```

---

### âœ… Full Working Example (from scratch):

If you just created a file like this:

```bash
echo "Day 33 practice" > Day33/note.txt
```

Then you'd do:

```bash
git add Day33
git status                            # Optional, but helpful
git commit -m "Added Day33 tasks"
git push
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Optional: To confirm push success

You can run:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

To see your last commit on the local repo.

And visit your GitHub repo online to confirm the folder `Day33` is now visible.

Let me know if you want a one-liner version for future use.
